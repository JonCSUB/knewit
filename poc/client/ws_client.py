# client/ws_client.py
# =====================================================================================
# PURPOSE
#   Reusable WebSocket client (no UI code) that:
#     - Maintains ONE persistent connection to the server
#     - Auto-reconnects with backoff if the connection drops
#     - Replies to 'ping' with 'pong' (heartbeat)
#     - Exposes `send(payload: dict)` and async callback `on_event(msg: dict)`
#
# KEY TECHNOLOGIES
#   - websockets: lightweight WS library for asyncio
#   - asyncio: Queue for outbound messages; tasks for recv/send loops
# =====================================================================================

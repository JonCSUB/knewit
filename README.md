Knewit is a real-time multiplayer quiz platform built with FastAPI (WebSocket server) and Textual (terminal UI clients). Teachers create sessions with unique codes, students join via their terminals, and everyone participates in live quizzes with instant answer tracking and leaderboards. The system features a lobby system, quiz creation tools, answer histograms, and score trackingâ€”all running entirely in the terminal.
